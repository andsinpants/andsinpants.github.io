  description: The cerebellum sits at the back of the brain, where its main function is to predict sensorimotor stimuli and sculpt behavior in response. By studying the cerebellum, many systems neuroscientists can glean new predictive mechanisms used by the brain to intepret theoretical underpinnings of sensorimotor correction. Olfaction involves adaptive, sensorimotor tracking of scented plumes in a ever-changing environment. How are olfactory positional cues incorporated within cerebellar circuits for precise motor output? Investigating this question was the crux of my postdoctoral work. Ultimately findings from such work can influence work from applying predictive behavior in neural networks to developing novel robotics for chemosensory detection.

  description: Odors are complex and hard to identify. How the brain can encode the identity of an odor is not well understood. In particular, the area that processes smell; the olfactory bulb, has many microcircuits to decode odor identity that are dependent on synaptic signaling. While the microcircuitry function of this area of the brain through excitatory neurotransmission has been analyzed in brain slices, it remains unknown if an odor drives postsynaptic excitation in one synaptic "hop" or two. Here we used novel sensors of the excitatory neurotransmitter; glutamate, to dissect the contributions of such microcircuitry and found that the one-hop hypothesis is likely correct.

  description: Network criticality is a measurement of how optimized a network is for information transfer. However, not much is known about how network criticality changes during active sampling. Myself and another Math PhD student, Jacob Madrid, have set out to explore network changes in criticality during sniffing and whisking.
