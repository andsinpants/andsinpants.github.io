    description: "The cerebellum sits at the back of the brain, where its main function is to predict sensorimotor stimuli and sculpt behavior in response. Therefore, by studying the cerebellum, many systems neuroscientists can glean new predictive mechanisms used by the brain to treat nervous system diseases, to create novel predictive algorithms utilized in machine learning, and to create better robotics. Here, we are investigating how sensorimotor transforms specific to olfactory navigatory behavior can influence cerebellar circuits for fine motor correction."

    description: "Odors are complex and how the brain can encode the identity of an odor is not well understood. Even more specific, the area that processes smell, the olfactory bulb, has many microcircuits to decode odor identity that are dependent on synaptic signaling. While the microcircuitry function of this area of the brain through excitatory neurotransmission has been analyzed, the debate still rages: Does an odor drive postsynaptic excitation in one synaptic "hop" or two? Here we used novel sensors of the excitatory neurotransmitter; glutamate, to dissect the contributions of such microcircuitry and found that the 1-hop hypothesis is probably correct."
