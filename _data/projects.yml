# Olfactocerebellar driven reaching
- project: Dissecting olfactocentric circuit contributions to sensorimotor drive in the cerebellum 
  role: Lead Postdoctoral Researcher
  duration: 2020 &mdash; Present

  description: The cerebellum sits at the back of the brain, where its main function is to predict sensorimotor stimuli and sculpt behavior in response. Therefore, by studying the cerebellum, many systems neuroscientists can glean new predictive mechanisms used by the brain to treat nervous system diseases, to create novel predictive algorithms utilized in machine learning, and to create better robotics. Here, we are investigating how sensorimotor transforms specific to olfactory navigatory behavior can influence cerebellar circuits for fine motor correction.

# Glutamatergic activity in the olfactory bulb
- project: Optical analysis of odor-driven glutamate dynamics in circuits of the mammalian olfactory bulb 
  role: Lead Graduate Student Researcher
  duration: 2017 &mdash; 2020

  description: Odors are complex and how the brain can encode the identity of an odor is not well understood. Even more specific, the area that processes smell, the olfactory bulb, has many microcircuits New neurotechnologies are constantly
