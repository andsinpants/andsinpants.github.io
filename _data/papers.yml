    briefly: "Electrophysiology and optical imaging are both parallel neurotechnologies used for studying neural activity. However, researchers tend to adopt one technology over the other with substantial limitations to either one. Why not combine both? As part of the CU Neurophotonics team at CU Anschutz, we designed and tested a device, capable of recording population data and single-cell responses simultaneously in head-fixed or freely moving rodents. We call it the GRINtrode. We hope to ultimately utilize this technology in studying neural dynamics across brain regions during odor plume navigation."

    briefly: "Here, we dissected the underlying sources of excitatory drive onto mitral/tufted cells in vivo using pharmacological methods. Surprisingly, we found a maintanence of glutamatergic drive onto these cells when blocking postsynaptic excitation, suggesting that the majority of feedforward excitation is driven in vivo by sensory input. This paper challenges the in vitro notion that diverse bulbar output activity is mostly shaped by intermediate circuitry."

    briefly: "Throught imaging the excitatory input onto dendrites of bulbar output cells (mitral/tufted cells) we discovered that odor-evoked, glutamatergic drive is diverse. This paper was the first to characterize second generation SF-iGluSnFRs (optical indicators of glutamate) and captured glutamate/calcium dynamics simultaneously in the mammalian olfactory bulb in vivo."
